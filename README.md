# Torus Knots

This repository contains a collection of P5 sketches that render torus knots.  From [Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TorusKnot.html):

"A (p,q)-torus knot is obtained by looping a string through the hole of a torus p times with q revolutions before joining its ends."

Daniel Shiffman renders a complex 3D knot in his [3D knot coding challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/87-3d-knots).

I am doing something simpler, which is rendering a torus knot.
